        "# **Problem Understanding**\n",
        "- We need to place N queens on an N x N chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other.\n",
        "  This means that no two queens should share the same row, column, or diagonal.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Our goal is to find a valid arrangement of queens that meets the above conditions.To achieve a solution efficiently using a genetic algorithm that can find the arrangement within a reasonable number of generations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Approach**\n",
        "We will solve this problem using a Genetic Algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Chromosome Representation**\n",
        "Each chromosome represents a potential solution to the problem, where each position in the chromosome indicates the row of a queen in a specific column.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Fitness Function**\n",
        "The fitness function evaluates how well a chromosome solves the N-Queens problem. It calculates the number of collisions (both horizontal and diagonal) between queens, with a higher fitness score indicating fewer collisions. The maximum fitness score is given, which represents the best possible arrangement.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Selection**\n",
        "A probabilistic selection process is used to choose chromosomes for reproduction based on their fitness scores. This ensures that fitter chromosomes have a higher chance of being selected for the next generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Crossover and Mutation**\n",
        "- **Crossover:** Two parent chromosomes are combined to produce a child chromosome. A random crossover point is selected, and the genes from both parents are joined to create the child.\n",
        "- **Mutation:** With a small probability, a queenâ€™s position in a chromosome is randomly changed. This introduces genetic diversity, which can help avoid local minima.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Evolution Process**\n",
        "The algorithm iterates through generations, repeatedly applying selection, crossover, and mutation to produce new populations until a solution is found or a predefined condition is met.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Constraints:**\n",
        "- **Problem Size:** The algorithm's performance may degrade with larger values of N due to increased complexity in evaluating fitness and generating solutions. The maximum fitness value is also dependent on N.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Randomness:** The stochastic nature of genetic algorithms means that results may vary between runs. While the algorithm is designed to converge towards a solution, there's no guarantee that it will always find an optimal arrangement within a limited number of generations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Mutation Probability:** The mutation rate is set to a low value (e.g., 3%), which may affect the algorithm's ability to explore the solution space effectively. A higher mutation rate could increase exploration but may also disrupt good solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Resource Limitations:** Depending on the implementation environment, memory and processing power might limit the size of N that can be effectively handled.\n",
