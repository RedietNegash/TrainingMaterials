        "      •\tWe are given a list of jobs, each identified by a unique job ID.\n",
        "      •\tThe objective is to schedule these jobs in a way that minimizes the total completion time ot the makespan.\n",

        "            1.Chromosome Representation: Each chromosome represents a sequence of jobs. The makespan is calculated as the sum of the job IDs.\n",
