# Genetic Algorithm Projects

This repository contains implementations of three problems solved using genetic algorithms:

## Projects Overview

### 1. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- **Description**: This project aims to find the shortest route that visits all given cities exactly once and returns to the starting city.
- **Algorithm**: Uses a genetic algorithm with operations including selection, crossover, and mutation.

### 2. Job Scheduling Problem
- **Description**: This project schedules a list of jobs to minimize the total completion time (makespan).
- **Algorithm**: Utilizes a genetic algorithm featuring one-point and two-point crossover methods, along with mutation.

### 3. N-Queens Problem
- **Description**: This project places N queens on an N x N chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other.
- **Algorithm**: Implements a genetic algorithm that evaluates fitness based on queen placements, employing selection, crossover, and mutation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RedietNegash/TrainingMaterials.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd TrainingMaterials
3. **change the branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout gp-rediet
